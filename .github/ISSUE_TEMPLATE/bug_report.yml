      - When reporting bugs, you'll make things easier (and the fix will come sooner) if you follow the guidelines in this template.
      - Write a descriptive issue title above.
      - The golden rule is to **always open *one* issue for *one* bug**. If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
      - Search [open](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to ensure it has not already been reported. If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, don't hesitate to **open a new issue**. The bugsquad will handle it from there if it's a duplicate.
      - Verify that you are using Godot 4.0 or obove.
      - Credit to [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) for the template.

      - A small Godot project which reproduces the issue, with no unnecessary files included. Be sure to not include the `.godot` folder in the archive (but keep `project.godot`).
      - Drag and drop a ZIP archive to upload it. **Do not select another field until the project is done uploading.**
      - **Note for C# users:** If your issue is *not* Mono-specific, please upload a minimal reproduction project written in GDScript or VisualScript. This will make it easier for contributors to reproduce the issue locally as not everyone has a Mono setup available.
