## Reporting Bugs
If you experience any functionality that breaks or otherwise causes undesired effects, please make a [Bug report](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.yml).

## Questions, Help & Advice
If you're looking to get help with anything, be it about how to use certain parts of the plugin or in general, then open a [Question/Help Wanted Discussion post](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/discussions/new?category=question-help-wanted) about the issue. If possible, please add visual examples, e.g. videos and illustrations, as that can help a lot with identifying what the desired goal is. 

## Feature Requests
If you wish the plugin had any particular functionality that would enhance how you, or others, would use it, then you can make a feature request using either of the two approaches below:
### Specific Feature
If you know exactly what problem you're looking to solve and vaguely how it could/should work, then submit a [Feature Proposal](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-proposal%2Cneeds-triage&projects=&template=feature_proposal.yml).

### Loosely Defined Feature
If you have very vague idea of a feature that would enhance the plugin, where there's no exact solution or use case in mind, then make an [Idea Discussion post](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/discussions/new?category=ideas). These will be discussed in more 

## Code Contribution & Pull Requests (PRs)
Contributions to fix or improve the plugin are welcome!

Existing issues marked with a [help wanted tag](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/labels/help%20wanted) are the best candidates for contributions. Issues with that tag are either not prioritised, or are in need of help with someone with more expertise within a certain area.

### Before opening a new pull request, please check the following:
1. Is the pull requests already covered in the list of [upcoming features](https://github.com/users/ramokz/projects/3)? 
   - **If so**, please post a comment in the specific issue to show interest in helping out.
     - This is to avoid having overlapping / double work PRs between maintainer and contributors.
2. Is there already an [existing issue](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/issues)? 
   - **If not**, please open a [Bug](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.yml) or [Feature Proposal](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-proposal%2Cneeds-triage&projects=&template=feature_proposal.yml) ticket and discuss the intent prior to doing any work.
     - This is to avoid having misaligned goals about what the plugin should and shouldn't do.
