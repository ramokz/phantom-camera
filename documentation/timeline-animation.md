# Timeline Animation
To switch between `PCams` using a timeline, in e.g. cutscenes, using an `AnimationPlayer` node, simply keyframe the `Priority` property to the desired value and time.

### Note
Note: Godot will currently output (many) errors when using this method. In spite of that, the workflow will work just fine. The issue is being tracked in [#99](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/issues/99)
