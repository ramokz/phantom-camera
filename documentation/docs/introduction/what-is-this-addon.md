`Phantom Camera` is a Godot 4 addon designed to provide and simplify common behaviors for the built-in `Camera2D` and `Camera3D` (`Camera`) nodes - heavily inspired by a Unity package called [Cinemachine](https://unity.com/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine).

It allows for simple behaviours such as follow or look at specific nodes with an optional smooth/dampened movement.

To more advance logic like re-framing itself to keep multiple nodes in view and dynamically animate between specific camera positions, i.e. other PhantomCamera nodes, on demand.
