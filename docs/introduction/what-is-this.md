`Phantom Camera` is a Godot 4 addon designed to simplify common `Camera2D` and `Camera3D` (`Camera`) behaviors and provide an comprehensive out-of-box camera experience for various project sizes and complexities. The addon is heavily inspired by a Unity package called [Cinemachine](https://unity.com/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine).

It allows for simple behaviours such as following or looking at specific nodes with an optional smoothing parameter to more advance logic like re-framing itself to keep multiple nodes in view and dynamically animate between different points in space.
