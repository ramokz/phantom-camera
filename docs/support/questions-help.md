# Questions & Help
Are you struggling with getting something to work? Does something not make any sense? Do you have an idea, but are not sure if you should submit a **Bug Report** or **Feature Request**?

If so, feel free to make a [discussion post](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/discussions/new/choose), you're likely not the only person who has had a particular question. Remember, there are **_no_** stupid questions!

Also feel free to reach out to me personally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcusskov), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@marcusskov) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/marcusskov.bsky.social) - DMs are always open and happy to help!
